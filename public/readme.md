# Dashboard Application

A simple e-commerce dashboard that allows users to manage their **Cart** and **Wishlist**. The dashboard lets users view, sort, and manage items in both sections. Users can sort cart items by **Price** and **Rating** in ascending or descending order. The app uses **localStorage** to persist data across page reloads.

## Features

- View items in **Cart** and **Wishlist**.
- **Sort by Price** (ascending and descending).
- **Sort by Rating** (ascending and descending).
- **Remove items** from both Cart and Wishlist.
- **Responsive layout** for mobile and desktop.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend JavaScript library for building the UI.
- **localStorage** - For persisting the data (cart and wishlist items) across page reloads.
- **CSS** (with basic styling) - For styling the UI components.
- **React Hooks** - Using `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and side effects.
